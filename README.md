# So where do I find this "data"?
Here's a few solid places. Bookmark these for sources for stories, or for story ideas! Look for outliers.

### Data.gov
All of the U.S. government’s open data. Nice, easy to use website. If you’re writing a story about climate change, you can easily search by that + Montana or U.S. to see what kind of data you need. From there, you download. 

### Census American Fact Finder
Basically all of the census data. The website is super dense and not super intuitive, but it’s a goldmine of census info, which is great because historically the census is super accurate, recurring by year so it’s reliable, and great for demographic-based stories (race, age, ect). 

### National Data Repository 
Wikipedia page of data hubs of different countries that are government funded / based. 

### Google Public Data Explorer
Can help you visualize a dataset. Kind of like Google search, it searches open datasets. Doesn’t have everything and the search can be tricky. But it can quickly show you what a dataset has in it without you having to analyze it and make your own infographic. You can easily see if the dataset is worth downloading, etc. 

### General searching tips
The File types PDF and Excel are often where the good data is.
* Google search: meth data filetype:pdf
** Searches only PDFS with those keywords 
* Google search “montana meth project” filetype:xls 
** Searches only Excel files with those exact terms
