# So where do I find this "data"?
Here's a few solid places. Bookmark these for sources for stories, or for story ideas! Look for outliers.

### [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
All of the U.S. government’s open data. Nice, easy to use website. If you’re writing a story about climate change, you can easily search by that + Montana or U.S. to see what kind of data you need. From there, you download. 

### [Census American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml)
Basically all of the census data. The website is super dense and not super intuitive, but it’s a goldmine of census info, which is great because historically the census is super accurate, recurring by year so it’s reliable, and great for demographic-based stories (race, age, ect). 

### [National Data Repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Data_Repository)
Wikipedia page of data hubs of different countries that are government funded / based. 

### [Google Public Data Explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
Can help you visualize a dataset. Kind of like Google search, it searches open datasets. Doesn’t have everything and the search can be tricky. But it can quickly show you what a dataset has in it without you having to analyze it and make your own infographic. You can easily see if the dataset is worth downloading, etc. 

### General searching tips
The File types PDF and Excel are often where the good data is.
* Google search: meth data filetype:pdf
  * Searches only PDFS with those keywords 
* Google search “montana meth project” filetype:xls 
  * Searches only Excel files with those exact terms
  
# Making your own data
Kelsey will tell you how to scrape the web! 

# Ok, so I have this data. What can I do with it?
Infographics are cool and good. Why? Infographics make stories more believable, make them more shareable, and more digestible for audiences. How your story is presented online is everything. Here are some tools that reporters (or anyone) can use to make their stories better — no coding or design knowledge involved. Here's a few starter tools:

## [Datawrapper](datawrapper.de)
Datawrapper notes from Kelsey's nicar talk 

## Knightlab tools
Knightlab is a leading innovator in journalism technology, and makes some cool stuff. Check out all of it at (Knightlab's website)[https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/]

## So much more
 * [DataViz Catalogue](http://datavizcatalogue.com/) — can search by both the type of chart or by function of what you want to show. Then shows you websites and tools of how to make them! Nice.
